      - "Provenance generally refers to the facts about the history of a piece of digital content assets (image, video, audio recording, document). C2PA enables the authors of provenance data to securely bind statements of provenance data to instances of content using their unique credentials. These provenance statements are called assertions by the C2PA. They may include assertions about who created the content and how, when, and where it was created. They may also include assertions about when and how it was edited throughout its life. The content author, and publisher (if authoring provenance data) always has control over whether to include provenance data as well as what assertions are included, such as whether to include identifying information (in order to allow for anonymous or pseudonymous assets). Included assertions can be removed in later edits without invalidating or removing all of the included provenance data in a process called redaction."
      - "In the C2PA Specifications, trust decisions are made by the consumer of the asset based on the identity of the actor(s) who signed the provenance data along with the information in the assertions contained in the provenance. This signing takes place at each significant moment in an asset’s life (e.g., creation, editing, etc.) through the use of the actor’s unique credentials and ensures that the provenance data remains cryptographically bound to the newly created or updated asset."
      - -> Less about Watermarking, and more about allowing authors and subsequent actors to sign assets and make this act publicly known to establish the asset's history.

    - Most likely, the watermark will include the prompt used to generate audio (e.g. Artist name). This allows for copyright claims.
